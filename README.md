# Welcome to LookingGlass 

LookingGlass is a general-purpose 'universal language of life' deep learning model for read-length biological sequences. It can be used for diverse downstream transfer learning tasks for biological data, some of which are described in the paper.

This is the main repository for these pretrained models. See more detailed descriptions of the models contained in this repository below.
